Easy Webtrends makes using Webtrends with Wordpress easy and straightforward. Once the plugin has been enabled, you can quickly load your tracking scripts through the Wordpress dashboard and start monitoring your traffic.

Through the Easy Webtrends options panel, you can quickly tag your entire site and the plugin will load these tags on each and every page.
